    "Explanation: \n",
    "\n",
    "This code simulates the Monty Hall problem. The Monty Hall problem is a famous probability puzzle that involves three doors: two of which have a goat and one of which has a car. When the player picks a door, the host will always reveal a door with a goat out of the remaining doors. The player can either switch or keep their door. The code explains why switching has a higher probability of winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line imports the NumPy library which is used for numerical and scientific computing. This is so we could use np.random.choice to choose a random door option later. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next lines set up the \"doors\" and choices. That is, a tuple is introduced for the possible door options (1, 2, and 3) and my_door_choice indicates the door chosen (door 1). reps = 100000 indicates this code was repeated 100000 times to calculate an accurate probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The for loop runs 100000 times. In the first secion, the \"secret_winning_door\", which represents the door with the car, is a random door (it switches for each iteration of the for loop). The list \"all_door_options_list\" is initialized to only have the losing doors so the host can reveal a losing door. In the try-except block, my_door_choice is also removed, as the host will not reveal our choice, then the goat is revealed. If my_door_choice was the winning door and was already removed, the try-except block ignores the code inside the \"try\" and randomly picks out of the remaining losing doors. Finally, the all_door_options_list removes the revealed door and adds back the secret_winning_door if it wasn't the our initial choice. In other words, if our initial choice was the secret_winning_door, the list will only contain a losing door in order to perform the \"switch\". If our initial choice was a losing door, the list will only contain the winning door so the player can switch to it. The code then increments the total wins by 1 if we switched to the winning door.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last line of the for loop calculates the success rate of switching the door which is close to 2/3."

Of course, in doing so, a ChatBot may introduce functions that you've technically not learned or seen before; but, the amount of simplification and clarifying comments is probably going to more than compensate for this; and, you'll have seen a learned a little bit more about what's possible through this process, which is the ideal experience we're hoping you'll see here._ \n",

    "This code suggested by ChatGPT is much cleaner and easier to read than the code before. ChatGPT makes this code more efficient in two ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is using list comprehensions which is a concise way of creating lists in the form of the following: \"expression\" for \"item\" in \"iterable\" if \"condition\". The expression is how you want to transform each item, the item is the element in the iterable, the iterable is what you loop through, and the conditional picks the items based on a condition. In this case, you add the door to the list, without any \"transformation\" from the \"expression\" part of the list comprehension, but you only add it if the door is not our intial choice or the winning door. In other words, you add one or two losing doors, depending on what your choice was, to remaining_doors so a losing door can revealed by the host. Using list comprehensions makes this code more readable than using \".remove()\" and try-except blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second change made is to avoid appending the winning door back. Instead, a new list is created, once again with list comprehensions, with the remaining untouched door and this door is stored into the variable switched_door by using the index [0]. This is done by picking the door in the all_doors list that is not the initial chocie or the revealed goat leaving only the untouched door left. This makes the switching process easier as the list comprehension already does the switching for you. All that's left is to check if the switched_door is the winning_door.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Monty Hall Simulation Code**:\n",

    "1. ChatGPT's explanation\n",
    "    - Extension 1: ChatGPT is able to understand that the first extension allows the model to use bigram dependency. It explains that instead of looping through each word, the extension loops through each pair of consecutive words in the \"for i, word in enumerate(words[:-2])\" line. This means that the \"next word\" is dependent on the previous two words. It also explains that the current word is combined with the next word to form a bigram and word_used2 tracks the frequency of the bigram occuring. Finally, it explains that next_word2 tracks how often the third word follows the bigram by using the bigram as the key and another dictionary for the frequencies of the third word.\n",
    "    - Extension 2: ChatGPT is also able to explain the second extension. It identifies that the second extension allows the chatbot to generate sentences that reflect how each character of \"Avatar\" speaks. It explains that the line that defines \"characters\" counts how many occurences of each character. In the nested dictionary, a recursive dictionary structure is created and again, word_used2C keeps track of the frequency of the bigrams while next_word2C keeps track of the next words for each character's bigrams. The main loop operates similar to before but this time, if the word is unique to a character, it assigns the word to character. This tells the chatbot to generate any \"next word\" based on the character. For each character, the bigrams formed are stored into the dictionary. The next word is once again stored based on the bigram and the character. This method uses many nested dictionaries.\n",
    "2. Clarifying what I don't understand\n",
    "    - Nested dictionaries: Nested dictionaries are created recursively in multiple levels. This dictionary has the key of the character. The key of the inner dictionary is the bigram, and the key of the inner-most dictionary is the word that follows the bigram.\n",
    "    - Counting the bigrams: The bigrams are counted per character. Inside the third if-block, if the bigram had not previously occured, it is initialized. Regardless of whether it is initialized or not, the occurence of the bigram is incremented by 1 as this iteration counts as seeing the bigram once. The same logic is used for creating the dictionary for \"next_word\"."

    "\n",
    "2. **Markovian Chatbot Extension #1**  \n",
    "   You extended the chatbot code by introducing **bigrams** (pairs of consecutive words):\n",
    "   - The extension modified the code to track transitions between pairs of words and their next word, instead of single words.\n",
    "   - This allowed the model to capture more context, improving the text generation quality by considering two-word sequences rather than just one.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Markovian Chatbot Extension #2**  \n",
    "   You introduced another extension where each bigram was modeled based on the **speaking patterns of characters** in a dataset (`avatar.character`). The code:\n",
    "   - Used a nested dictionary (`word_used2C` and `next_word2C`) to track bigrams and next words specific to each character.\n",
    "   - This allowed the model to differentiate between characters and generate more character-specific text, reflecting the language patterns of individual speakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Explanation of Key Concepts**  \n",
    "   - **Nested Dictionaries**: I explained how nested dictionaries work in Python, allowing data to be organized hierarchically. In your chatbot code, this was used to store bigrams and next-word counts specific to characters.\n",
    "   - **How Bigrams Are Tracked**: I provided a detailed breakdown of the code that checks for the existence of a bigram for each character and increments its count. This logic ensures that word sequences are properly tracked and counted for different speakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Usefulness of the Code**  \n",
    "   - The code extensions add complexity to the Markov chain, allowing more accurate predictions by tracking context through bigrams and characters.\n",

For example, when provided with complicated code directly, ChatGPT only gave an outline of what the code does but provided no detail about each lines of code. It only mentioned that the second extension counted the occurences of each character's name, used a nested dictionary, and stored word pairs but gave no further detail. It gives short and general answers without explaining the purpose of each line of code. In these cases, more prompting had to be done in order to get the answers I wanted. In general, I was able to get helpful answers after one or two additional prompts.\n",

    "2. Interacting with ChatGPT was not frustrating or unhelpful. This is because, in general, ChatGPT was able to determine what I was asking and provide a focused answer tailored to the code I had given it after one or two extra prompts. After prompting, ChatGPT looks each line of the code and gives a readable explanation of each line does. This allows me to better understand the code and to learn new methods and functions within the NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy datasets. While ChatGPT does occasionally provide vague answers, as mentioned above, after prompting the ChatBot with a few more questions, ChatGPT is able to explain the concept. Furthermore, ChatGPT did provide a vague answer to how the nested dictionary work, but it is likely due to the complexity of this line of code. Although ChatGPT provided a general explanation for this code, I still found its explanation of simpler concepts useful and detailed. Ultiamtely, I did not find interacting with ChatGPT to be frustrating or unhelpful. \n",

    "3. Overall, ChatGPT is a useful tool to help me understand code. As previously explained, ChatGPT provides answers specific to code and datasets that I feed it, allowing me to understand the code in the context of where it is being used. It is much more helpful for troubleshooting errors than Google Search as it is able to analyze the code and error I give it and create an explanation on how to fix the issue. Using Google for errors and explanations, on the other hand, is more time consuming and difficult to understand as Google does not filter any explanations specific to your code, forcing you to read the many links with information that might not be relevant. One downside of ChatGPT is its inability toe explain complex concepts in detail, as mentioned with the nested dictionary and the second extension. However, ultimately, ChatGPT is useful to explain simple concepts in a concise and easy-to-understand manner."

I believed that in order to learn, one should learn information in the lecture and apply it on their own without assistance from a ChatBot. However, after interacting with ChatGPT for two weeks, my perception has changed. I found that by using ChatGPT, I actually learned more than I would without it. ChatGPT was able to explain concepts to me in a focused manner, filtering out all the unnecessary and irrelevant information that a Google Search would have given me. In combination with what I learned from the lecture, I found myself grasping the concepts easier than without ChatGPT. Furthermore, using ChatGPT to code helped me focus on the concepts that are more important to the course (for example how to clean data) rather than learning the Python syntax. Finally, I found ChatBots useful to troubleshoot code as they were able to identify and explain the errors simply and clearly. Though some concepts were too complicated for the ChatBot causing it to provide a vague explanation, in general, using ChatGPT in this course has changed my view of ChatBots and has allowed me to see the potential of AI in the field of statistics."

    "In the future, I aim to have a possible career in bioinformatics, a field in which one must use statistics to analyze biological data. In order to be successful in this career, I must have soft-skills and transferable skills to enhance my performance in both the statistics and biology parts of this career. Firstly, skills that apply to both fields include the ability to learn, to adapt, to communicate, and to analyze. As the life sciences and statistics fields advance, it is crucial to have the ability to learn new skills quickly and to adapt to these changes, especially in bioinformatics which combines biology, computer science, and statistics. For example, as technology is integrated into life science and healthcare, I must be able to adapt and to keep up with new methodologies and technologies in order to be successful in this career. To build these skills, I will shadow professors and researchers as observing how they work and the environment which can help me learn to adapt to an environment similar to my future workplace. Furthermore, I can develop my ability to learn by attending competitions on biology or statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to communicate and to analyze information are also vital to be successful in the bioinformatics field. Communication, in any field, is required for collaboration and teamwork. In the field of bioinformatics, communication is required to present findings clearly to other clinicians. Analysis is also important as it allows me to solve problems and make decisions. Specifically in the field of bioinformatics, seeing trends in data, drawing rational conclusions about genes and their functions, and relationships between genes all require the ability to think logically and to analyze. In order to build these skills, I can apply for research that requires me to communicate with a team to share my findings and to draw conclusions from data found.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, coding and knowledge of statistics are both required for bioinformatics. As many careers become dependent on technology, knowing how to code and knowing basic statistics is vital to be successful. In bioinformatics, languages like Python, R, and Perl are used when large amounts of data about gene sequences must be analyzed. Code and statistics can help analyze large datasets by running models, developing algorithms, showing trends, and testing hypotheses. To further develop my coding and statistics skills, I can make use of ChatBots to learn the basics of coding and statistics. I can also attend competitions, as mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, both soft-skills and skills like coding and statistics are crucial in the job of bioinformatics.\n"
